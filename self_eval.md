# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? 
*When you want to compare items and provide different outputs depending on the results/mix.*
2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
*I would commit more often.*
3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
*I had to work through several errors and research things on my own with a combo of the mod curriculum, my notes, and google (ruby-docs etc.). Sticking with it and seeing the solutions work was really satisfying.*
