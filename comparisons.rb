# PART 1: Comparing variables
#-------------------

number_teachers = 4
number_students = 20
string_teachers = "4"
numberDogs = 0

puts "# PART 1: Comparing variables"

# EXAMPLE: print the result of the comparison: is number_seachers greater than number_students?
puts "Is number_teachers greater than number_students?", number_teachers > number_students
# this should print: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_teachers less than number_students?
# this should print: true

puts "Is number_teachers less than number_students?", number_teachers < number_students

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_teachers equal to string_teachers?
# this should print: false

puts "Is number_teachers equal to string_teachers?", number_teachers == string_teachers

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_teachers not equal to number_students?
# this should print: true

puts "Is number_teachers not equal to number_students?", number_teachers != number_students

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_students greater than or equal to 20?
# this should print: true

puts "Is number_students greater than or equal to 20?", number_students >= 20

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_students greater than or equal to 21?
# this should print: false

puts "Is number_students greater than or equal to 21?", number_students >= 21

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_students less than or equal to 20?

puts "Is number_students less than or equal to 20?", number_students <= 20

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_students less than or equal to 21?

# PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
#-------------------

# For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a Comment,
# in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.
# Be as technically precise as possible, but don't just copy and paste a definition from the readings.
# Make sure YOU can explain it that way!

puts "PART 2: Articulating what you are doing"

puts 4 < 9
#YOU DO: Explain. 
# put to terminal - Is the integer 4 less than the integer 9?
# --> true

books = 3
puts 4 < books
# YOU DO: Explain.
# Assign books variable to 3
# put to terminal - Is the integer 4 less than the integer 3?
# --> false

friends = 6
siblings = 2
puts friends > siblings
# YOU DO: Explain.
# Assign friends variable to 6
# Assign siblings variable to 2
# put to terminal - Is the integer 6 greater than the integer 2?
# --> true

attendees = 9
meals = 8
puts attendees != meals
# YOU DO: Explain.
# Assign attendees variable to 9
# Assign meals variable to 8
# put to terminal - Is the integer 9 not equal to the integer 2?
# --> true

# PART 3: Logical Operators
#-------------------

is_hungry = true
finished_homework = false

# EXAMPLE:
# Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
puts is_hungry && finished_homework
# Determine if the user is hungry or has completed their homework
puts is_hungry || finished_homework

loves_to_play = true
loves_dog_park = false
loves_treats = true
age = 1

puts "PART 3: Logical Operators"

# YOU DO:
# Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
puts loves_to_play && loves_treats

# Determine if the dog loves to play and loves the dog park
puts loves_to_play && loves_dog_park

# Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
puts loves_to_play || loves_dog_park

# Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy
# Assume that a dog is a puppy if it is less than 2 years old.
puts loves_to_play && age < 2

# What did your final line of code evaluate to? Why do you think that is? Explain.
# ANSWER:
# it evaluated to true. Not sure what the extra question/explanation is for...
